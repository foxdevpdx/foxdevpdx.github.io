## Intro to Web Dev Final Project
**CS410: Intro to Web Dev**
*Devon Fox Spring 2022*

This website is the final project of Intro to Web Dev at Portland State University.  It's a culmination of getting initial experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   In this assignment, I used Bootstrap 5.2 to style the site, and referenced code found in the [official documention](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/).  I did use some custom CSS to further style the Bootstrap implementation, however, it was only supplemental.  I used jQuery and ajax to implement a call to the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) free weather API.  In addition, to simplify my form submission without needing to use php or any server-side code, I used [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/) to accept the form submissions sent via my contact page and forward the information to my e-mail.

* To run the code locally, simply clone this repository to your local hard drive, and run the `index.html` file from within a browser (best viewed in Chrome or Firefox)
* Alternatively, one can navigate to the deployed site above and view the site in it's current state, hosted on the GitHub servers.
